# microblock's QoL Utils

[简体中文](README.md)

A Windows-first QoL utility mod for Celeste + Everest. The portable font, icon,
and UI rasterizer can also be built for Linux and macOS. MiaoNet, CollabUtils2,
and SpeedrunTool are optional runtime integrations rather than hard dependencies.

## Features

### UI and system helpers

- Material You-style HUD cards, settings pages, chapter select, and Everest mod
  options. HUD surfaces, acrylic blur, and the global mod-options replacement
  can be toggled independently.
- A custom QOL settings page with category navigation, setting search, mouse,
  keyboard, and controller input. Everest's binding pages and custom setting
  entries keep their original behavior.
- An opt-in replacement chapter browser with recent chapters, level-set
  navigation, search, author/description/tag metadata, and keyboard, controller,
  mouse, and wheel input. It enters chapters through the normal OuiChapterPanel
  flow and honors the official unlock limits.
- Reflection-only CollabUtils2 support. Collab maps and gyms are hidden by
  default, can be exposed by an advanced option, and are grouped into collapsible
  lobby sections when possible.
- Embedded Material Symbols and a portable font renderer. Text is rasterized at
  its physical output size and cached; the default font is Microsoft YaHei UI,
  with a chooser for installed font families and 80%-160% font scaling.
- Windows HiDPI support and optional input-language switching: text fields use a
  Chinese keyboard layout while normal gameplay uses an English layout.
- Optional removal of room transitions and death animation. Collision boxes have
  hidden, overlaid, and collision-only modes.
- A Microblock QOL Tools entry is added to the pause menu.

### HUD and minimap

### High-frame-rate presentation

Celeste's simulation remains fixed at 60 Hz. When the optional MotionSmoothing mod is
installed and its decoupled tick mode is enabled, this mod detects it and keeps its
recording and HUD integrations compatible with the interpolated presentation. Use
`qol_framestat` in the Everest console to inspect the detected state.

FSR Frame Generation and NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation are not implemented as a
post-process toggle here. They require the renderer to provide a swapchain plus color,
depth, and motion-vector textures for every frame. Celeste's FNA/XNA 2D renderer does
not expose that integration point, and interpolating the final image would corrupt
pixel-art edges, menus, particles, and game timing. Driver-level frame generation may
still be used externally where the GPU driver supports it, but it is outside this mod.

The native capture hook already observes D3D11 `IDXGISwapChain::Present`, which is the
right boundary for diagnostics but too late for a correct FSR/DLSS integration: only
the composited backbuffer remains. Adding another Present hook would duplicate that
image rather than provide the depth and motion-vector inputs required by frame
generation.

For Celeste, MotionSmoothing is the supported in-game route: it interpolates the
camera and actor presentation while preserving the 60 Hz physics contract. Do not
enable two interpolation layers at once; if an external driver frame generator is
active, disable it when visual artifacts or added latency appear.

- Rolling FPS, CPU frame time, and—when Motion Smoothing is available—separate
  physics and render FPS.
- Optional frame-spike notices and a lightweight frame-profiler HUD.
- A circular or square minimap rendered from the live solid-tile grid:
  - configurable size, zoom, and keyboard/controller zoom bindings;
  - room bounds, room backgrounds, opacity, and adaptive colors;
  - cached shortest routes and remaining-room count to the map's inferred goal;
  - strawberry, golden strawberry, moonberry, heart, cassette, key, and gem markers;
  - persistent collection state from the current save, with optional edge markers
    for strawberries in nearby rooms.
- Optional MiaoNet players, avatars, off-screen players, and names on the minimap.
  Names can be hidden, limited to watched players, or shown for everyone.
- Optional suppression of MiaoNet's native off-screen name labels.

### MiaoNet watching and notifications

When MiaoNet is present, the mod reads same-map player positions, rooms, names,
and avatars through reflection. If MiaoNet is absent, the mod still loads normally.

Everest console commands:

~~~text
qol_watch <player>
qol_unwatch <player>
qol_watch_list
~~~

The MiaoNet chat box also registers /qol (alias /mu):

~~~text
/qol watch <player>
/qol unwatch <player>
/qol list
~~~

On Windows, a system notification is shown when a watched player changes rooms
while Celeste is not the foreground application.

### Recording and death replays

Windows, Linux and macOS share an SDL OpenGL native-hook source; there is no desktop
capture service, permission picker, or screen-coordinate dependency. Set
`--graphics OpenGL` in `everest-launch.txt` and restart (or set
`FNA3D_FORCE_DRIVER=OpenGL` before launch). The installer adds the launch flag only when
no explicit renderer override exists and backs up the config under `.work`. Plain ZIP
installation requires configuring this manually; explicit overrides are preserved.
OpenGL 3.2 is required (GLES 3 is the future Android extension point).

PBO readback is submitted **before** `SDL_GL_SwapWindow`, with zero-timeout fence
polling on subsequent frames. A worker converts/distributes owned BGRA pixels;
encoding and consumer callbacks never run on the render thread. Resizing rebuilds
PBOs; no subscribers means no readback. No desktop recording permission is needed.
Frame-rate selection happens only at acquisition. Equal-rate recordings share the selected images;
downstream queues and recorders do not resample them. SFX uses the continuous master mixer clock,
and internal-save audio pause/resume follows retained-video boundaries.
See [capture architecture and testing](docs/capture-architecture.md).

- Automatic recording can cover every room or only runs carrying a golden berry.
- Manual recording can be started, saved, and discarded from the settings page or
  through console commands. Starting and stopping/saving can also use separate,
  optional keyboard or controller bindings; both are unbound by default.
- Full recordings and death replays use independent encoding/editing sessions sharing one pixel/FMOD source. Death
  replays retain the latest 30 seconds by default, configurable from 10 to 60
  seconds, save after death, and resume automatically after respawn.
- Continuous H.264 death replays reuse the live encoder's packets rather than encoding video twice;
  adjacent room/music metadata splits keep this fast path. MP4 edit lists hide decoder preroll at
  non-keyframe cuts while retaining SFX, reconstructed BGM and room-specific music policy.
  Pause cuts, freeze-frame editing and incompatible streams fall back to the exact editor.
  Capture queue draining, audio encoding and file finalization still take time; this is not a
  zero-latency guarantee under every workload.
- Continuous capture keeps only successful segments. Deaths, room transitions,
  pauses, SpeedrunTool loads, and custom respawn-point changes affect the final
  edit list without putting failed gameplay into the final video.
- On area completion, the native finalizer reads only retained ranges and produces
  a gapless MP4. The in-game recording library shows finalization progress and
  supports separate full/death views, opening, and deletion.
- The default output root is
  %USERPROFILE%\Videos\Celeste\microblocks-qol-recordings. It can be changed in
  settings. Completed files are stored under full/<area> and deaths/<area>;
  each MP4 also has a .timeline.json sidecar.
- Video prefers the platform H.264 encoder (Media Foundation on Windows,
  VideoToolbox on macOS, and NVENC/QSV on Linux). Linux falls back to MPEG-4 Part 2
  in the MP4 container when no directly usable H.264 encoder is available. Audio
  uses AAC. Frame rate, bitrate, encoder preference, and retention
  limits are configurable.
- Gameplay, UI SFX, and music are recorded as timestamped FMOD event commands in `.sfxevents` and
  `.music.jsonl`; no audio PCM is stored during capture. During finalization, Celeste's FMOD banks replay
  both journals in a separate offline NRT system: retained SFX starts follow the video edit, with one-shot tails continuing across cuts, while music is rendered
  on a continuous output timeline before AAC mixing. MKV files under `.working` are therefore silent
  intermediates; play the finalized MP4 files under `full` or `deaths` instead.
- BGM can use the captured game mix or SfxOnlyWithPostMix. The latter edits only
  gameplay/UI SFX against the video timeline and lays the event-rendered
  music onto a continuous post-mix timeline across deaths and pauses. A clean
  mapped file replaces only its matching event segment. Maps containing cassette
  blocks, rhythm entities, or music-sync entities automatically retain the
  captured game mix to preserve timing.

BgmEventMapFile is an optional JSON object. Relative paths are resolved from the
directory containing the JSON file:

~~~json
{
  "event:/music/lvl1/main": "D:/Celeste-BGM/first_steps.flac"
}
~~~

Without a mapping, Celeste's FMOD music events are used as the post-mix BGM source.
Custom-map music uses the needed loaded Everest banks and their GUID aliases too;
an unavailable replay event is reported as an export error instead of silent audio.
Retained one-shot SFX play to completion across edits and recorded stop/release calls
(within the exported video's duration). Looping/sustained sounds still honor stops
and fade out at removed branches. Sounds that begin in discarded footage are not replayed.

The recording setting **Remove freeze frames** is disabled by default. When enabled, finalization
detects stalls in the captured timeline and removes those intervals from the video, audio, and BGM
timelines. The enabled state is highlighted in the settings page.

### Profiler

The Profiler page can start a 10-second in-process EventPipe stack sample:

- update and render are reported separately;
- entries show exclusive CPU time, percentage, owning mod assembly, and MonoMod
  hook target;
- a Mod-only simple view and a full professional view are available;
- CSV and .nettrace reports are written to
  %LOCALAPPDATA%\MicroblocksQolUtils\profiles;
- the lightweight frame-time HUD remains available without a full sample.

The recording option **Auto-save on room transitions (video continuity)** is enabled by default.
While full recording is active (including manual recording), it saves the game and recording
timeline into a dedicated internal SpeedrunTool slot after each room transition. Normal same-room
deaths load that slot automatically; golden chapter restarts and custom death actions are not
intercepted. Recording start and respawn-point changes also refresh the recovery point.
**Manual saves affect only the death target, never normal automatic-save triggers.** If the selected user slot has a valid
save and SRT's death auto-load is enabled, SRT owns recovery. Otherwise, the current branch's automatic version is used
when valid, never a different branch or a future checkpoint.
SRT alone handles manual-slot death recovery; its waits, wipes and input behavior are unchanged.
We only segment video and restore valid saved recording prefixes, preferring hard cuts for those joins.
SRT progress-only presentations never enter frame acquisition or advance recovery gates; their wait time is cut too, including clear/GC operations.
Each user slot binds an immutable video prefix and its automatic fallback version. Overwriting/clearing slots only changes
references; it never immediately saves, loads, or replaces the active video branch.
Internal saving freezes gameplay until clean resume frames reach both recordings. It reuses SRT's save/preclone indicator
when available, with our own indicator only as a fallback.
Video and event sources live on disk under `.working/<area>` in the recording directory. Branches share these files; RAM holds
buffers, edit references and retained game snapshots. Branch restoration is limited to the same full-recording session;
loading an older save without matching footage starts a fresh prefix rather than fabricating a seamless connection.
It preserves user slots/selection, existing marks and normal death/time statistics, adds no timer/golden-berry
marks, and does not require SRT's death-auto-load setting for private recovery. Stopping recording/disabling the feature releases private versions.
Death-replay-only capture, disabled/missing/incompatible SRT, active TAS and TAS-owned selected
slots are skipped safely.

## Console commands

In addition to the watching commands above, recording and native capture expose:

~~~text
qol_capture_probe_start
qol_capture_probe_stats
qol_capture_probe_stop

qol_record_start
qol_record_save
qol_record_discard
qol_record_status
~~~

The capture probe is for development diagnostics: it reports shared SDL capture,
queue depth, dropped frames, and media time without enabling normal recording.

## Build and install

The default Celeste path is:

~~~text
C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Celeste
~~~

The build entry point requires Node.js, the .NET 8 SDK, Rust, and the native
toolchain for the selected target. A complete Windows recording build additionally
requires:

- Visual Studio C++ Build Tools;
- LLVM/Clang, including libclang.dll and clang-cl.exe;
- MSYS2 with GNU make, Perl, and NASM;
- tar.

A complete Linux build also needs Clang/libclang, GNU make, pkg-config, and the
FFmpeg encoder development packages. A complete macOS build needs Xcode
Command Line Tools. Every platform builds a verified FFmpeg 8.1 source archive
into the minimal LGPL shared runtime packaged with the mod.

The repository script builds the managed mod, native rasterizer, and the current
platform's capture/recording backend, then writes Build plus MicroblocksQolUtils.zip:

~~~powershell
node scripts/build-qol-mod.mjs
~~~

Build and install to the default Celeste installation:

~~~powershell
node scripts/build-qol-mod.mjs --install
~~~

Set CELESTE_ROOT when Celeste is installed elsewhere. Close the game first; the
script refuses to replace DLLs loaded by a running Celeste process:

~~~powershell
$env:CELESTE_ROOT = "D:\Games\Celeste"
node scripts/build-qol-mod.mjs --install
~~~

Targets used by CI can be selected explicitly:

~~~powershell
node scripts/build-qol-mod.mjs --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
node scripts/build-qol-mod.mjs --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
node scripts/build-qol-mod.mjs --target x86_64-apple-darwin
~~~

Windows, Linux, and macOS builds all include recording and their FFmpeg shared
runtime. The universal archive places them in Everest's `Code/lib-win-x64`,
`Code/lib-linux`, and `Code/lib-osx` platform directories so Everest only loads
the current platform's variant. Only Windows system notifications remain
platform-specific. Runtime code does not package or invoke an ffmpeg executable.

GitHub Actions runs Rust formatting/tests and builds Windows x64, Linux x64,
and macOS x64 variants, then merges them into one universal
`MicroblocksQolUtils.zip`. Every commit pushed to master updates the nightly
pre-release; tags matching v* publish the same universal archive as a versioned
release.

## Dependency notes

- MiaoNet, CollabUtils2, and SpeedrunTool are optional runtime bridges.
- Material Symbols are embedded in the repository.
- Source/CaptureSource.cs and CaptureSubscription.cs own shared acquisition and isolated subscriptions.
- Source/SdlFrameSource.cs and Native/src/sdl_readback.rs implement SDL hooks and PBO readback.
- Tests/Capture and Capture.Integration exercise subscriptions, clocks, and real SDL/FMOD encoding.

### Automatic recording rules

Automatic recording has Off / Full chapter / Golden challenge modes. Golden challenges can stop at berry collection or chapter completion. On death, choose discard, continue (retain the failed attempt and record until chapter completion), or save. These policies are fixed when the recording starts. Stopping never arms manual recording or immediately restarts the automatic session. A new golden pickup re-arms golden mode; full-chapter mode waits for the next chapter or an explicit off/on.

Recording settings use six tabs: Automatic, Death replay, Quality/audio, Storage, Controls, and Library. The library separates manual (`full/<area>`), automatic (`auto/<area>`), and death (`deaths/<area>`) recordings with independent retention limits. Existing files stay in their original location and remain in the manual/legacy category.
